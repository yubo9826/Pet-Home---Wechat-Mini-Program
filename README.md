## Shortcomings and Improvement Plans

Currently, the project still has the following points that can be optimized:

- ‚ùå No backend support, data is local simulation
- ‚ùå Weak user interaction functions (such as commenting, liking, sharing)
- ‚ùå Lack of data persistence and user system
- ‚ùå Performance and compatibility await further testing

**Future plans:**
- Develop a backend management system
- Add user authentication and data encryption
- Introduce cloud development or build your own server
- Optimize performance and user experience

## Course Reflections

This project is the final work of the "Mobile Internet Application Development" course. Through this development practice, I have deeply studied WeChat Mini Program development, Vue.js framework, responsive design and front-end engineering, etc., and improved my project construction and problem-solving abilities.
